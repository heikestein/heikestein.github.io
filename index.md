## About me

I am a neuroscientist interested in cognition and motor functions. I recently completed my PhD with Albert Compte in the [Brain Circuits and Behavior lab](https://braincircuitsbehavior.org/) in Barcelona, where I worked on the role of NMDA receptors for working memory, and on the interaction of activity- and plasticity-based neural processes in prefrontal cortex. Before my PhD, I studied psychology and cognitive neuroscience, but soon became more and more interested in computational neuroscience and questions best answered by looking at neural circuits. Since 2020, I am a postdoc in [Alex Cayco Gajic's group](https://sites.google.com/view/caycogajic/home) at ENS Paris, where I study cerebellar population dynamics and cortico-cerebellar interactions.
